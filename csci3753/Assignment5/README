Programming Assignment 5
A FUSE Encrypted File System

Various files adopted from other exiting work.
See file comments for specific details and references.

---Dependencies---
fuse-utils
openssl
attr
attr-dev
libfuse-dev
libssl1.0.0 or libssl0.9.8
libssl-dev

Note: To use extended attributes (xattr) on EXT filesystems,
      you must add the 'user_xattr' mount option to the
      mount options of any mounts on which you intend to use 
      extended attributes. Failure to so may result in an error
      when trying to set, get, or remove xattr values.

***Building***

Build All:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

***pa5-encfs Example***

This example will walk through you through mirroring a directory "root/" and "mirror/"

Create Directory  
 mkdir root
 mkdir mirror

Navigate into "root/" and create a file "new.txt"
 cd root
 echo new file > new.txt
 cd ..

Mirror the directory in debug mode "root/" in "mirror/" with password "pass"
 ./pa5-encfs -d pass root mirror

Add a file to "mirror"
 cd mirror
 echo new file 2 > enc.txt

Add a subdirectory "sub" 
 mkdir sub

Root is now...
 new.txt	// This file is not encrypted (because it was in the directory before mounting)
 enc.txt	// This file is encrypted
 sub

Mirror is now...
 new.txt 	// This file is not encrypted
 enc.txt 	// This file is not encrypted
 sub

Unmount the filesystem
 fusermount -u mirror


***General Usage***

Mount the directory
 ./pa5-encfs <Password> <Root Directory> <Mount Directory>

Unmount the directory
 fusermount -u <Mount Directory>
