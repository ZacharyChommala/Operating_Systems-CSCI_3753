---Description---

This program is designed to take an unknown number of input files
containing only domain names and use DNS lookup on each. The result 
is then printed in an output file in the format:
	
	domainname.com,some.standard.ip

The queue is entirely threadsafe and currently supports a dynamic amount 
of threads to perform DNS lookup. The number of resolver threads
is determined from detecting the number of cores on your computer.

Note the use of semaphores and threads in multi-lookup.c. While the concept
of the program is fairly simple, it does lay out the groundwork of a larger
project and it demonstrates the proper use of threadsafe mechanisms. 

---Usage---

Build:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

Run:
 ./multi-lookup <path/to/input1> <path/to/input2> <path/to/output>
 ***NOTE: Program can support as many input files as you wish to provide***

Check solution for memory leaks:
 valgrind ./multi-lookup <path/to/input> <path/to/output>
